# Running tests

To run tests, run the following command:

```
npm test
```

This should run jest, our javascript testing framework of choice.

The result should look something like this:

```
> dotjs-leaderboardd@1.0.0 test
> jest

Test Suites: 1 skipped, 0 of 1 total
Tests:       1 skipped, 1 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        3.266 s, estimated 4 s
Ran all test suites.

```

Great! Our tests are running!

Time for some refactoring...

### Locate the file being tested and move it

Im not happy with the current test structure. I want to separate code and tests a bit.

under the `app` folder , create a new folder named `__tests__`.
In `__tests__` add a new folder `pages`.
Move `index.text.tsx` from app/pages to this folder.
Change line 4 to: `import Home from "app/pages/index"` (Since we moved the test file, we need to update the reference to the file we are testing)

#### Run the tests again

```
npm tests
```

If you get the same result as earlier, great! Move successful!

### Lets get the test red!

Change from `test.skip` to `it`. This makes so our test framework no longer skips the test when looking for tests.
